# 7DRL 2021 "Cryptozoologist"

Main idea: violence-less rogue-like: You enter a dungeon to take pictures of its denizens in their natural habitat, to gain fame and prestige as a Cryptozoologist.

- Approach the creatures without startling them into fleeing or attacking you and breaking your camera.
- Use bait and sound to draw creatures to certain places
- Take picture of creatures doing special things for extra points. Just make sure not to shake the camera!
